# Getting Started

## Abstract

Ontology DID, also referred to as **ONT ID**, is a decentralized identification protocol based on W3C DID specifications. It supports collaborative services such as distributed and diversified ownership confirmation, identification, and authentication of various entities including individuals, legal bodies, objects, and content. ONT ID establishes a cryptography-based digital identity for each entity, allowing sovereignty over data authorization and ownership confirmation, which ensure that identity and data assets are truly something that the user can control. 

ONT ID has the following characteristics:

1. Decentralization
2. Self-management
3. Privacy protection and security
4. Ease of use

Ontology establishes a decentralized trust model and distributed trust delivery system through ONT ID and verifiable claims. It uses the **C-L signature algorithm** and **zero-knowledge proof protocol** to assure privacy protection of the verifiable claims. Through ONT ID, Ontology will also incorporate and link various authentication service agencies, and establish multi-source authentication of an entity's identity to achieve a composite and more complete picture.

In addition to relying on specific central entities to build trust relationships, entities can also build equally strong trust relationships by themselves. **Trust transfer** is achieved through mutual authentication between entities. Entities will have higher credibility if they receive more authentications from other entities â€“ especially if said entities have high levels of credibility.
