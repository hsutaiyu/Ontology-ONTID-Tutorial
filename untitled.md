# Application and development scope

By employing the applications that undergone decentralization remodeling, it possible to implement virtually every different kind of personal account management system, and at the same time ensure the user's **data privacy** ownership.

This hands the control back to the user ensuring that all the actions that use data do so only after user authentication, there by providing a **potential solution** to the the problem of **leakage** and **misuse** of data, which is one of the pain points of centralized data systems.

**ONT ID** is used to carry out data verification and validation services for the **Ontology trust framework**.

A step ahead, with the support of Ontology Trust Mechanism, Ontology has provided a wider variety of schemes to allow users to divert to Ontology's applications. ONT ID also plans to provide solutions and technical support for rapid development and operation of Ontology applications.

Stay tuned for more information and guides on **Ontology trust mechanism**.
